		<h2>Hello!</h2>
		<p>My name is Dănescu Alexia Loredana and I am a student at the Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Information Technology from Technical University of Cluj-Napoca.</p>
		<p>I was born and raised in Târgoviște, Dâmbovița, but I came to study in Cluj-Napoca because I was atracted by the beautiful architecture and Transylvania’ s lifestyle, but mostly because of the warmth and kindness of people. </p>
		<p>I am a dynamic and curious person, so I am enthusiastic about learning new things. From the beginning to the end of the academic year I don’t miss an opportunity to get involved in any student's activities.</p>
		<p>In my freshman's year I participated in hackathons and I was selected to participate in a course where I learned the basics of programming in PYTHON. The trainer was a professor from my University and the course was supported by Q_Perior.</p>	
		<p> Also, I am a member of ROBOTELIER, a team of students that are passionate about robotics. There I learned ARDUINO and 3D printing. Our team also organizes ELECTROCAMP every year. It’s a 2-day Arduino training for high school students, followed by a contest in which they have to make a small-scale project, based on what they learned. Last year I participated there as VOLUNTEER.</p>	
 		<p>This year, I joined the RIVER PROJECT TEAM from Romania. I am part of the Automation and Navigation subsystem.</p>
